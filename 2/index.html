            <h2>Why we are building Plain API-first</h2>
            <p class="subtext">Over the last decade, engineering infrastructure across virtually every company area has become more advanced: Payments, communications, data, and so forth. What used to take teams in high-growth companies entire quarters to accomplish now takes individual engineers a few days.<br>This shift has happened in every area but customer service. There, the choice remains between maintaining a patchwork of hacks, fighting the rigid structures of established platforms, or wiring together cloud call centre solutions and building homegrown ticketing systems.<br>We are building Plain to change this - to make great customer service, at every scale, plain and simple.</p>
